# Myth-Weaver Sheet Reader

Retrieves the data from Myth-Weavers character sheets, saves the data in a readable format, and lists all changes that were made to the character sheets since the last time the program retrieved their data. The list of differences is saved in an Excel workbook, with each character sheet's differences stored in a separate worksheet.

The user must enter their Myth-Weavers username and password to access private sheets, although this data is not stored by the client.

Note: In previous versions, the program scraped the data from character sheets, but has now been updated to use the new API Myth-Weavers introduced to receive character sheet data. This update does not change anything on the user's end.
